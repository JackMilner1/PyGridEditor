## Features and prerequisites
A tool for the pygame framework for creating maps with tilesets without even needing to leave your code editor. It provides options to save your maps to your project, load them into your game when needed, export your maps if you want to view them elsewhere as well as providing functionality to load your own tilesets into the project. This tool can be activated at anytime by typing ```pygrideditor``` into your terminal where you will be greeted with the editor that will contain all of the maps you've created for your project as well as all of your tilesets.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have installed the PyGridEditor before typing commands otherwise it wont work. This can be done as follows ```pip3 install pygrideditor```

## Future ambitions

In terms of the future of this project as it is in early development I plan on working on the completion of v1.0.0 for the project which consists of all of the features in the [features and prerequisites](https://github.com/JackMilner1/PyGridEditor/edit/main/README.md#features-and-prerequisites) section
